# PLS Model for Yeast Biomass Prediction  

This repository contains my implementation of a **Partial Least Squares (PLS)** regression model in MATLAB, developed for the course *Machine Learning for Process Engineering (SP25)* at the University of Padova.  

The goal of the project was to predict the **final yeast biomass concentration** in batch fermentations of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, using online process data collected under normal operating conditions.

## Repository Contents  

- **PLS_assignment_description.pdf**  
  Original assignment description provided by the professor, detailing the problem and dataset structure.  

- **PLS_dataset.mat**  
  Dataset containing historical yeast fermentation data, including seven process variables collected over time and the corresponding end-point biomass concentrations.  

- **lavrenchuk_MLfPE_PLS.m**  
  MATLAB script implementing the PLS regression model. This file performs calibration on the dataset and applies the model to predict biomass concentrations for validation batches.  

- **lavrenchuk_MLfPE_PLS.mat**  
  MATLAB output file containing the saved numerical solutions and results generated by running the `.m` script.  

- **report_MLfPE_PLS.pdf**  
  Final report discussing the model development, methodology, and results of the assignment. Includes interpretation of PLS components and prediction accuracy.  

- **README.md**  
  Documentation file (you are here).

## How to Run  

1. Open `lavrenchuk_MLfPE_PLS.m` in MATLAB.  
2. Load the dataset (`PLS_dataset.mat`).  
3. Run the script to train the PLS model and generate predictions.  
4. Check results in the MATLAB workspace or use the saved output (`lavrenchuk_MLfPE_PLS.mat`).
